Im also an assistant professor at University of Torino, teaching a course on complex networks. My work focuses on the analysis of complex, temporal and proximity networks, with a particular emphasis on finding appropriate and interpretable representations of these high-dimensional data structures. I use methods at the crossroad of statistical physics, mathematics and computer science. My interests span from theoretical problems to data driven ones with applications to social sciences, epidemiology and human behavior modeling.\nFor few more details, download my CV. --","date":1763942400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"taxonomy","lang":"en","lastmod":1763942400,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"/author/lorenzo-dallamico/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/author/lorenzo-dallamico/","section":"authors","summary":"I am currently a postodoctoral fellow in the group led by Prof. Ciro Cattuto at the ISI foundation in Turin, Italy.
