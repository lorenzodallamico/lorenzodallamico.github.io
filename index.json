The ability of recovering properties of items starting from their interaction has key applications in many fields, ranging from biology, to social science, passing through electronics and Physics. Clustering is the ability to group the items of a system in categories sharing similar properties. The spectral techinques represent a fast solution to this problem. Solving this problem for sparse and heterogenous networks is of utmost importance to address the problem on real graphs.\n Related works At the following links you may find papers, slides, videos and codes related to my work in this project.\n  Spectral methods for graph clustering  Nishimori meets Bethe: a spectral method for node classification in sparse weighted graphs  Community detection in sparse time-evolving graphs with a dynamical Bethe-Hessian  Optimal Laplacian regularization for sparse spectral community detection  A unified framework for spectral clustering in sparse graphs  Revisiting the Bethe-Hessian: Improved Community Detection in Sparse Heterogeneous Graphs  Community detection in sparse realistic graphs: improving the Bethe-Hessian  ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"e402298dd041e473f79f79f093e7d51b","permalink":"/project/sc/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/sc/","section":"project","summary":"Retrieving the community structure of a sparse graph is a challenging and deeply studied problem.
