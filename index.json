The Sociopatterns collaboration developed proximity sensors that are capable to measure contact patterns with a high resolution in both time and space. We deployed these sensors in schools, hospital and offices, but the focus has also been towards sub-Saharan African countries such as Kenya, Malawi and South-Africa that have to tolerate the highest epidemic burdens.\nThe scope of this project is to study the proximity measurements to understand better how humans interact (especially in low-resources countries) and being able to devise efficient epidemic mitigation polices.\n Related works   Estimating household contact matrices structure from easily collectable metadata  ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"5ab922d879d5ffd9f23d19866d959b32","permalink":"/project/sociopatterns/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/sociopatterns/","section":"project","summary":"We measure human proximity to better understand human interactions with a particular interest to low-income countries","tags":["data for good","graph science","machine learning"],"title":"Study of f2f interactions","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Network theory is of central importance in interdisciplinary science. The ability of recovering properties of items starting from their interaction has key applications in many fields, ranging from biology, to social science, passing through electronics and Physics. Clustering is the ability to group the items of a system in categories sharing similar properties. The spectral techinques represent a fast solution to this problem. Solving this problem for sparse and heterogenous networks is of utmost importance to address the problem on real graphs.\n Related works At the following links you may find papers, slides, videos and codes related to my work in this project.\n  Spectral methods for graph clustering  Nishimori meets Bethe: a spectral method for node classification in sparse weighted graphs  Community detection in sparse time-evolving graphs with a dynamical Bethe-Hessian  Optimal Laplacian regularization for sparse spectral community detection  A unified framework for spectral clustering in sparse graphs  Revisiting the Bethe-Hessian: Improved Community Detection in Sparse Heterogeneous Graphs  Community detection in sparse realistic graphs: improving the Bethe-Hessian  ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"e402298dd041e473f79f79f093e7d51b","permalink":"/project/sc/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/sc/","section":"project","summary":"Retrieving the community structure of a sparse graph is a challenging and deeply studied problem.

The sum of the individuals’ actions, however, does not correspond to the behavior of the whole system that tends to a very fascinating self-organization that attracted the study of many theoretical physicists.
